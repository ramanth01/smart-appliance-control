- Simple and readable Python code
- Beginner-friendly logic and functions
- Single file execution (main.py)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Standard Python Libraries

## 📂 Folder Structure
smart-appliance-control/
├── main.py            # Core script containing the appliance control logic
└── README.md          # Project documentation
## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Install Python 3
2. Navigate to the folder in terminal:
cd smart-appliance-control
3. Run the script:
python main.py
## 🎯 Project Purpose
- Strengthen Python basics
- Practice functions, loops, and conditional logic
- Build confidence in writing clean programs
